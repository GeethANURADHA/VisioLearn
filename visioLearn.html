					<p>The International Association for the Prevention of Blindness reports that there are 43 million blind people worldwide, with an additional 295 million suffering from moderate to severe visual impairments. The National Blindness Survey in Sri Lanka alone projects that 350,000 people are classified as blind, and an additional 340,000 have severe vision impairments. In spite of the fact that technological literacy is imperative, visually impaired students encounter substantial obstacles when attempting to access IT education, which is critical for their personal and professional development. Students who are visually challenged cannot access most of the current e-learning platforms because they are primarily developed with visual material and interfaces. When it comes to providing the required modifications, these platforms frequently fall short, which puts visually impaired students at a competitive disadvantage. Studies show that because elearning systems primarily rely on visual resources and lack appropriate assistive 
technologies, visually impaired students face more difficulties. Voice-based chatbots have become a viable way to improve visually impaired students' access to e-learning. Due to their reliance on text-based interactions, traditional chatbots are not appropriate for users with visual impairments. Conversely, voice-based chatbots, which make use of speech recognition and synthesis technology, can offer an engaging and easily accessible educational experience. These chatbots can assist visually impaired learners by guiding them through instructional content, responding to questions, and evaluating their level of knowledge through voice conversations. Numerous research endeavors have examined the incorporation of chatbots into online learning environments, emphasizing their capacity to enhance academic achievements through the provision of tailored and prompt support to numerous learners concurrently. Nevertheless, accessibility for students with visual impairments is sometimes overlooked in the design of these chatbots. For example, a lot of chatbots employ datasets in AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language), which are less sophisticated and versatile than more recent options like JSON. JSON is a superior option for creating inclusive chatbots 
since it is more easily ported between platforms and simplifies. Virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Cortana have shown how much voice-based technology may help people with vision impairments carry out regular duties. These technologies are capable of comprehending and reacting to human language, making it easier to do a variety of tasks by using voice instructions. They improve independence and productivity in daily tasks by helping users with reminders, messaging, scheduling, and even controlling smart home appliances. However, there is a significant gap in their incorporation into educational environments, especially in IT education for visually impaired students, despite their ubiquitous success in general applications. More emphasis has been placed on real-world applications than on scholarly justification. This disparity is significant because it deprives visually impaired pupils of the resources they need to participate fully in IT education. 

The lack of appropriate supervision in IT education sometimes prevents visually challenged students from entering the sector. Their ability to advance professionally is limited by this lack of mentoring and instructional tools. By providing individualized module recommendations and evaluating students' knowledge, voice-based chatbots can be implemented in e-learning platforms to assist close this knowledge gap. By ensuring that students get a solid foundation in IT before moving on to more advanced subjects, this customized approach improves both their educational experience and future employability. 
Technology that detects emotions can improve education even further by revealing how pupils are feeling when taking tests. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown in studies to be an effective tool for real-time emotion recognition. This means that teachers may better understand and support the emotional needs of visually impaired children while they learn. An environment for learning that is more responsive and encouraging may result from the integration of emotion detection with e-learning systems. These developments have the potential to empower visually impaired students by addressing the particular difficulties they encounter and giving them the resources and assistance they require to thrive in the digital age. This study emphasizes how crucial inclusive education is and how technology can be used to give everyone access to fair learning opportunities. </p>

				 </br>
					<h4 class="highlight">In what ways can online learning platforms facilitate connections between visually impaired students and potential employers in the IT industry, promoting inclusivity and equal opportunities for employment?</h4>
					<p></p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">.The most significant professional and educational obstacles that visually impaired students in 
the field of information technology (IT) experience are the subject of this study's research 
problem. Students who are visually impaired face considerable challenges while trying to 
access digital content, which makes it difficult for them to learn and understand IT classes. 
These difficulties cause people to lose confidence and believe that their impairment prevents 
them from learning and performing well in IT, which ultimately reduces their possibilities in 
the IT job market.
The educational methodologies that are currently in use frequently rely primarily on-screen 
readers and tactile methods, which may not fully suit the learning demands of visually impaired 
students despite the developments in assistive technologies. These approaches may not be 
sufficient to deliver a thorough, interactive, and engaging learning environment, especially 
when it comes to difficult subjects like programming, algorithms, and business management 
and security related to IT. 

The goal of this project is to create and assess a voice-based chatbot that can be incorporated 
into e-learning platforms in order to address these problems. The purpose of this technology is 
to provide visually impaired students with a more tailored and accessible learning 
environment. By using voice commands to browse the web app, the suggested method enables 
these students to interact with the content more easily and independently of visual signals. By 
offering recommendations for modules that are appropriate for each user's knowledge level 
and interests, the chatbot will assist users in their learning process and create a customized 
educational experience.
The next question we got in this research is how to teach programming to a visually impaired 
child who does not have any IT related knowledge.For this, we have to increase their 
computational thinking knowledge first, so we decided to do it through the process of 
teaching flowcharts, algorithms and pseudo code.And since their progress needs to be 
known through this E-learning system, they are identified through various examinations. For 
that, actions like emotion detection and confidence detection are used and the progress is measured by them. Deep Furthermore, the research aims to investigate novel pedagogical approaches that may augment the computational reasoning abilities of visually impaired pupils. One method for teaching programming ideas in a more comprehensible way is to use tangible flowcharts and algorithms. To make learning more engaging and enjoyable, another strategy uses gamification and activities, which aids in students' comprehension of computational thinking. Additionally, the 
study will look into non-traditional techniques like mood and confidence detection to gauge and monitor visually impaired pupils' development. Throughout their educational journey, these techniques will offer insightful information about the emotional and confidence states of the pupils. Through the analysis of these measures, teachers can modify the curriculum to better meet the needs and emotional states of their students, which will improve their overall learning experience and results. Finally, the research will investigate methods for establishing connections between visually 
challenged students and IT industry employers. It is essential to make sure that the abilities learned via the online learning platform can be applied to actual job openings. This entails setting up a system that allows students to keep up a profile that highlights their abilities, development, and accomplishments. Employers can use these profiles to reach out to visually impaired candidates for training and employment, making the transition from education to the workforce easier. Through equitable possibilities for success in the IT industry, this project seeks to remove barriers for visually impaired students in the labor market.

				 <h5><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></h5>
				 </br>
				 <p style="text-align: justify;"> The main aim of the research is to provide an accessible online learning environment that uses voice-activated technologies to improve the quality of education for visually impaired students studying information technology (IT). This platform's goal is to remove the current obstacles to accessing digital content by offering easily accessible, interesting, and useful learning modules in important IT domains like security,business management, programming, and algorithms. The platform will facilitate a more inclusive and participatory learning environment by allowing visually impaired students to navigate and interact with the instructional content through voice commands by integrating voice assistants. Furthermore, the study intends to apply novel techniques for monitoring and evaluating visually impaired students' development using non-traditional metrics including mood and confidence detection. These discoveries will make it possible to modify instructional materials to better meet the requirements and preferences of each learner. The study will also investigate methods for putting these students in touch with possible IT industry employers. The platform will help close the skills gap between education and employment by establishing a system where students can maintain profiles showcasing their accomplishments. This will guarantee that the skills gained through the e-learning platform translate into actual job opportunities and fulfilling careers in the IT industry.	</P>

                  <p>The proposed IoT system and mobile application consists of 5 main components. They are;</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sensor data gathering (pH, temperature, turbidity)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Predict current water quality parameters and future water quality paramete forecasting.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Chemicals that need to bring water pH value to optimal level and chemical calculation</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Early disease risk identification, disease risk forecasting and disease data visualization</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Identify carp fish feeding behaviours</strong></li>
                  </ol>
				  <p> The proposed solution provides a smart approach for fish farmers, researchers, and industry specialists to detect water quality conditions and identify the risk of diseases. As shown in Fig. 3, the device contains an ESP32 module, pH sensor, and turbidity sensor. The temperature of the water controls every aspect of the fishpond's operation. Along with regulating the growth and development of the pond's vegetation and other animals, it also regulates the amount of oxygen in the water. The optimal temperature for river-dwelling fish, such as trout, is around 14°C. With a 2°C allowed range, 25°C is the best temperature for tropical fish. 20 to 25°C is the ideal water temperature for carp fish growth and reproduction [12]. We used an ESP32 Microcontroller as the main board in the system we designed. It is a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-integrated low-cost and low-power chip microcontroller [15].
            We used the DS18B20 Temperature probe to keep track of the water's temperature. It uses a single wire bus for communication and requires a power supply ranging from 3.0V to 5.5V. operational temperature range is between -10°C and 85°C with an accuracy of +/-0.5 °C.[13].
            The turbidity sensor need 5V DC to operate. The response time is roughly 500ms, and the operating current is 40mA. It provides both digital output and analogue output between 0 and 4.5V. The adapter's dimensions are 38mm*28mm*10mm/1.5inches *1.1inches*0.4inches, and it can function between 5°C and 90°C [14].
            To measure the pH value used a pH probe sensor. The module power is 5.00V, size 43mmx32mm, measuring range 0-14ph and temperature range is 0-60°C accuracy is ± 0.1pH (25 ℃) and the response time is ≤ 1min.

				  <p>Three sensors temperature, turbidity and pH sensor were used to get the real-time data. We've also created a mobile app for React Native that allows farmers to keep an eye on the relevant water quality metrics detected by smart ponds or tank sensors. The monitored data is directly stored in a cloud database and the app reads the data and shows the real-time data on a dashboard. The main purpose of the system is to predict future water conditions, diseases and future diseases and notify the carp fish farmers. The results of the developed machine learning models learning process highlight its prediction accuracy.

The program reads the monitored data from a cloud database and displays the real-time information on a dashboard.
            Utilizing real-time farm information enables you to identify problems before they materialize because the projection is based on the most recent data. The evolution of one parameter and the evolution of external factors might be related. We have utilized the ML model to estimate the major variables influencing the development of the smart fishpond based on the real-time observations of a variety of data. Numerous studies have shown that water temperature is one of the most crucial factors affecting water dissolved oxygen levels. Several factors, including the kind of aquaculture, have a significant impact on the dissolved oxygen levels in aquaculture systems. Depending on the nature of production, these factors' impact varies. The majority, however, may be measured and taken into account by an Internet of Things-based prediction model. Some of these parameters include the feeds' chemical composition and nutritional content. Additionally, it's important to take into account the length, feed level, and biomass of sh as well as algal biomass in fish systems.</p>
